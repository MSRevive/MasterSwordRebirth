# Master Sword Rebirth
The continuation of Master Sword Continued, a total HL1 conversion mod.

## Building
* You will need to clone the repository with the flag: ``--recurse-submodules`` to get all the submodules with it.
* Lastest version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.24 or greater. Avoid version 3.28 and 3.28.1 because they will fail to download VCPKG dependencies.

### Windows
* Visual Studios 2015 or higher, prefered [Visual Studios 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
* Latest version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.24 or greater.
* You can either generate project files by running ``createall.bat`` or manually run CMake by ``cmake -S . -B ./build -A Win32``

Currently the project relies on C++14, but we do plan on upgrading to a newer version.

## Compiling For Linux
* `sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`
* `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`
* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt install -y g++-11-multilib libgcc-s1:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libatomic1:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev:i386`
* `./build-linux.sh`
