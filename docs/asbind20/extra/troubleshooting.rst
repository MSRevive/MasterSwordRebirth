Troubleshooting
===============

This page provides some common troubles and their solutions.
Besides, If you encounter some runtime error that hard to understand, you can check the following list for help.

1. Duplicate Methods/Functions
------------------------------

You may see words like ``ALREADY_REGISTERED`` being reported by message callback. This is caused by registering a method/function for the second time.
A common cause is registering something manually after calling a helper for generating registered functions/methods/behaviours. For example, the code manually registers default constructor/copy constructor/assignment operator (``opAssign``)/destructor after using ``behaviours_by_traits()``, which will register the above behaviours.

2. Mismatched Function Signature
--------------------------------

Please check carefully the function signature in AngelScript and C++ are perfectly matched. Especially when dealing with platform-dependent types, for example, ``size_t``. Besides, a common mistake may be registering a function accepting ``const char*`` / ``std::string_view`` as accepting ``string`` as its argument. You can create a wrapper function, or registered them by lambda.

3. Invalid Type Flags for Value Type
------------------------------------

AngelScript needs a precise type information to use a value type in native calling convention. Please check the official document for details. A common mistake is forgetting to set ``asOBJ_APP_CLASS_MORE_CONSTRUCTORS`` before registering constructors other than default/copy constructor.
If you think the problem is caused by the native calling convention and is hard to fix, you can try to force ``asbind20`` to register all things in generic mode, as described at :ref:`here <group-force-generic>`. If switching to generic mode fix your problem, you can be 90% sure the problem is caused by invalid type flags.

Note for Windows + MSVC User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see something like "SEH exception with code 0xC0000005", try the solution in 2 and 3.
