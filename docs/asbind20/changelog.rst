Changelog
=========

Changelog since the version 1.5.0.

1.7.0
-----

Update
~~~~~~

- Fully support of x86 (32bit) Windows platform, including special treatment for ``__stdcall``.

Breaking Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Redesign interfaces of ``container::single`` to reduce some surprising behaviors.
  For example, the destructor won't clean the data, you need to call another function for releasing the data.

Bug fix
~~~~~~~

- Fix mismatched declaration in array extension that may cause crash on x86 platform.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- GCC 12 support is dropped due to too many workarounds. Please use GCC 13 or newer.

1.6.0
-----

2025-6-14

Update
~~~~~~

- Helper for registering modulo operator.
- Composite property support.
- Composite methods support including generic wrapper with or without variable types.
- Official arm64 support. Previously, it works theoretically but not actually tested.
- New tools for managing script function without increasing its reference count.
  It's useful when the programmer has deep understanding about the lifetime and want to write zero overhead code.
- Adjust file structure for maintenance.
- Slightly optimize memory usage of ``small_vector``.

Breaking Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed ``script_function_base``. Use ``script_function<void>`` instead.
- ``asbind20::meta::compressed_pair`` changed to ``asbind20::compressed_pair``
- ``asbind20::meta::overloaded`` changed to ``asbind20::overloaded``

Bug fix
~~~~~~~

- Update compatibility with ``string_view`` of binding generators.
- Fix compilation error when using an integer bigger than 8 bytes,
  such as ``__int128`` extension provided by Clang and GCC.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix typo and wrong link.
- Fix highlight script for AngelScript.
- Add entrance for extension library for future update. (Currently, the documents of extensions are still incomplete)

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Support of GCC 12 will be dropped in the next release, because it requires too many workarounds. Please use GCC 13 or newer.

1.5.2
-----

2025-5-13

Update
~~~~~~

Complete support of using AngelScript interfaces within ``AngelScript::`` namespace. (Thanks `GitHub @sashi0034 <https://github.com/sashi0034>`_)

1.5.1
-----

2025-4-21

Update
~~~~~~

- Some interfaces  of ``container::single`` will return a ``bool`` value for checking result

Bug fix
~~~~~~~

- Exception guarantee for ``notify_gc`` policy
- Exception guarantee for ``small_vector``
- Fix memory leaks if any exception occurs in generated constructors / factories

1.5.0

2025-3-31

What's New
~~~~~~~~~~

Core Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New tools for binding complex operator overloads
- Interfaces of binding generator now all take ``std::string`` / ``std::string_view`` instead of ``const char*`` for convenience and consistency
- Tools for multithreading with AngelScript
- New tool named ``overload_cast`` for choosing desired overloaded functions

Extension Library

First stable version of extension library released!

Please check the comment in source code of extension for their documentation.
Full documentation for extension library is coming soon.

Documentation

Rewrite and migrate to Read the Docs.
